📟 LED Counter (Tang Nano – VHDL)
  This project implements a configurable LED counter for the Tang Nano FPGA board using VHDL.
  The counting speed can be selected via onboard switches.

🔧 Features
  6-bit binary LED counter
  Switch-selectable counting speed
  Designed for 27 MHz Tang Nano clock
  Active-low LED output support

🛠️ Tools Used
  VHDL
  Gowin EDA
  Tang Nano FPGA

📌 Notes
  Default clock frequency: 27 MHz
  LED outputs are inverted to match hardware behavior
