📟 LED Counter (Tang Nano – VHDL)
---
  This project implements a configurable LED counter for the Tang Nano FPGA board using VHDL.  
  The counting speed can be selected via onboard switches.

🔧 Features
---
- 6-bit binary LED counter
- Switch-selectable counting speed
- Designed for 27 MHz Tang Nano clock
- Active-low LED output support
