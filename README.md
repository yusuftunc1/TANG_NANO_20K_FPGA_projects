🔷 Tang Nano 20K FPGA Projects 
---
📌 Overview
---
This repository presents a collection of FPGA-based digital design projects developed on the Tang Nano 20K platform.  
The primary objective of these works is to explore and implement fundamental and intermediate digital design concepts using VHDL, with an emphasis on timing-aware hardware design and synthesizable architectures.  

Each project is organized in a dedicated directory and documented individually to ensure clarity, modularity, and reproducibility.  

📁 Project Scope
---
The projects in this repository address the following topics:  
- Fundamental FPGA design methodologies  
- Synchronous digital design  
- Clocking, timing constraints, and static timing analysis  
- Pulse-width modulation (PWM)  
- Implementation of communication protocols such as UART, SPI, and I2C  
- Advanced design considerations: pipelining, clock domain crossing (CDC), and soft processor integration 
- End-to-end build flow with synthesis, implementation, and bitstream generation   

🛠️ Development Environment
---
-  Target FPGA Board: Tang Nano 20K  
-  Hardware Description Language: VHDL  
-  EDA Toolchain: Gowin EDA
-  Simulation: GHDL and GtkWave

All designs are intended to be fully synthesizable and verified on real hardware.  

🧠 Design Philosophy
---
The repository follows these principles:  
-  Explicit and readable RTL descriptions  
-  Parameterizable designs using generics  
-  Strictly synchronous logic where applicable  
-  Avoidance of vendor-specific primitives unless necessary  

 This approach ensures portability, maintainability, and pedagogical value.
